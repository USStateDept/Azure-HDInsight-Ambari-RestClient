# Ambari.RestClient

This RestSharp client can be used to Automate management of Azure HDInsight clusters using Ambari. Almost any action performed by the Ambari client can be automated.

Due to the nature of Ambari's Rest Server, you will want to re-use the AmbariRestClient class.

This project has working tests that support User creation and Role assignment.


Unfortunately, the swagger.json of Ambari is not very good and the Request and Response objects will need editing to support other features.

The client classes were generated by SwaggerHub.
